   physfs.nvim
</h1>

`physfs.nvim` is a Lua binding for `PhysicsFS`, a library to provide abstract access to various archives, specifically targeting Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT. This repository hosts an adapted version of Xavier Wang's [`lua-physfs`](https://github.com/starwing/lua-physfs) library, updated to use system installed `PhysicsFS`, `LuaCATS` annotations, and formatted as a plugin for `lazy.nvim`
